  This script has 5 functions to build a prompt of time series traffic forecast by Prophet model.
  The prompt will be use to send to distilgpt2 model, an AI mondel trained to generate english, human readable response.

  Enhance pa sa future if needed, Bali separate functions kasi separate prompts and separate responses ang gagawin
